      <description>A 2d truss solver.
Controls:
 Click on nodes to select Click and drag to move nodes With a node selected click on other nodes to toggle connection. Click on trash with a node selected to delete it Double-Click on a node to begin forcing it. Click again to create a force in that direction with magnitude proportional to the distance between the node and click.  </description>

      <description>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense &amp;quot;related&amp;quot;. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.</description>
