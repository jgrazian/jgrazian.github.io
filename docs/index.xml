      <description>My previous experiment posts use a little Math/Geometry engine I wrote in Rust and compiled to Web-Assembly that I call &amp;lsquo;Newton-2d&amp;rsquo;. In my truss solver uses the WASM engine to solve the matrix problem discussed in the post by using Gaussian Elimination. Naive Gaussian Elimination is an O(n^3) algorithm so it quickly becomes quite unruly at larger matrix sizes so I figured that WASM would speed things up a bit. I decied to actually test this hypothesis here where I run the same GE algorithm in Javascript and WASM.</description>

      <description>E (GPa) | Ïƒyield (MPa) | A (m2) Position (m) | Force (kN)
Controls:  Click on nodes to select Click and drag to move nodes With a node selected click on other nodes to toggle connection. Use the mouse wheel to rotate a fixed or roller node. To delete a node select it then click &amp;lsquo;Trash&amp;rsquo; Double-Click on a node to add force in the direction of the next mouse click.</description>

      <title>Experiment #1: Graphs</title>

      <description>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense &amp;quot;related&amp;quot;. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.</description>

      <description>My name is Joseph Graziano. I have a degree in Ocean Engineering from Virginia Tech but am working as a sowftware engineer at Raytheon Technologies. I plan on posting my random coding experiences and thoughts here.
